// Warm Up Practice

// 1. Use an assignment operator to modify a variable



// 2. Use a unary operator to modify a variable


// 3. Make an example for the use of a ternary operator



// 4. Write an example for an if/else if/else statement (can do an example of price,
// quantitity and quality rating. Depending on quantity & quality if else statement sets
// the price)


// 5. Write an example for a switch statement (difficulty with switch & #'s how does this work?)
// Looks like switch doesn't work with comparison operators... can't seem to use <, >, etc.
// Does work when checking against the actual number.
// Solution is to check against 'true' in switch statement. This isn't designed to work this way I
// read so better to just use an if/else statement.



// 6. Write if/else or switch examples using logical operators and comparison operators
