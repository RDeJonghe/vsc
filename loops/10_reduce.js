// .reduce() Another way to iterate over arrays
// can use .reduce() to build .forEach(), .map() and .filter so it's complex
// can also build other iterative methods with this
// accumulator - a part of reduce,

// example from book of reduce
let arr = [
  2,
  3,
  5,
  7
];
arr.reduce((accumulator, element) => accumulator + element, 0);
//= 17

arr.reduce((accumulator, element) => accumulator * element, 1);
//= 210

// string example from book with reduce. Note the accumulator is set to an empty string.
let strings = [
  'a',
  'b',
  'c',
  'd'
];
console.log(
  strings.reduce((accumulator, element) => {
    return accumulator + element.toUpperCase();
  }, '')
);
