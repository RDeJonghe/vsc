// do... while: Has backwards syntax. Will run once even if it is false


// 1. Make a do... while example that evaluates to true on initinal run. Make a number array and push random numbers into the array until the array has a certain length.





// Answer
/*
let numArr = [];

do{
  numArr.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 11));
  console.log(numArr);
}
while (numArr.length < 10)
*/



// 2. Show example where do while runs even though it is false. Use example of adding ++ to a number, initial condidtion is false, still does it





// Answer
/*
let num = 10;

do{
  num ++;
  console.log(num + ' this ran once even though it was false');
}
while(num < 5);
*/
