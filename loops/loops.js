// PRACTICE LOOPS

// for loop - has 3 expressions: 1. initialization(set iterator variable); 2. stopping condition;
// 3. iteration statement (update iterator variable on each loop)

// 1. make a counter with for loop

for (let counter = 1; counter < 20; counter += 2) {
  console.log(counter);
}

// 2. make a reverse counter with a for loop

// 3. loop over an array of cities, saying you want to visit each

// Nested Loops - when a loop is running inside another loop. Good use for this is to
// compare elements in two arrays
// 4. Do a nested loop comparing numbers and another nested loop comparing strings, .push() to an array

// While loop - used for when we don't know how many times the loop should run (think of example
// of eating... you don't know how many bites, you eat while hungry)
// variable outside of syntax

// 5. do a while loop with numbers, then do the while loop example with cards (can also use break
// in card example with an if statement)

// DO... WHILE statements - used when you want code to run at least once and then loop based
// on a condition after the initial run
// variable outside of syntax, syntax has reversed order for () and {}
// Do.. While is different from While. Do... While will run at least once even if it evaluates
// to false

// 6. Make a do... while example, and also show how it will run even if it evaluates to false

// break keyword allows you to stop the loop even if it still evaluates to true
// use the break keyword with an if statement for an example
// can also do example with cards, break if joker

// in this example see how you can actually console the index before exam scores? Shows index order
/*
